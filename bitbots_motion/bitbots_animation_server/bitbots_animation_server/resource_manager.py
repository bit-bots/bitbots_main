ResourceManager

The ResourceManager module provides functions to search and list animations for a given robot.
Thus, it is possible to find resources without knowing the current location in the file system.

        This method searches in all folders in `path` recursively for the file
        specified in folders + filename. If folders is a list, every item of the list will
        be treated as a single folder. This can be used to search in multiple folders.

        An IOError is raised when the file has not been found.

        Example:
        When
            search("/home/bitbots/test/bla/", "res/anim/", "data.json")

        is called, the following paths will be searched:
