        **NOTE:** Currently the only way to takeover a node is to stop the original process, then

        Parameters
        ----------
        kill_after: float, optional
            Kill the node process if it takes longer than this many seconds to shutdown. Disabled when <= 0.
        node_args : dict[str, Any], optional
            Additional arguments to pass to the node. See [Node][] for additional details.

        Node
            The new node instance that should replace this foreign node.
