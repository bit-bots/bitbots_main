Configure host names
--------------------

This is helpful, if you don't want to always type out the full IP address of our robots when no DNS server is available (e.g. at a competition).

Append the following lines to your ``/etc/hosts`` file:

.. code:: bash

   172.20.1.11     nuc1 amy
   172.20.1.12     nuc2 rory
   172.20.1.13     nuc3 jack
   172.20.1.14     nuc4 donna
   172.20.1.15     nuc5 melody
   172.20.1.16     nuc6 rose
